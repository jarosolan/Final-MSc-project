Step by step I will explain every step of this CNN application in this Deep Learning model from data acquisition, through data preparation, training, validation and finally testing. I am going also to explain how this DL model could be applied in Data Engineering process of data pipeline improvement.

1. Methodology
2. Data source
3. Implementation: training, validation, test.
4. Summary
